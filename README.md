# 📚 OCR Language Scanner App

A personal learning project built using **Apple Vision Framework**, **Natural Language Kit**, and **AVSpeechSynthesizer** to scan printed text, detect its language, and read it aloud using text-to-speech.  

This app is part of my journey to explore **machine learning and natural language processing on-device with Apple technologies**.

## ✨ Features

- 📷 **OCR with VisionKit**  
  Capture and extract text from camera input or images using Apple’s built-in Vision framework.

- 🌐 **Language Detection**  
  Automatically detects the primary language of the scanned text using `NLLanguageRecognizer`.

- 🔊 **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**  
  Reads the scanned text aloud in the detected language using `AVSpeechSynthesizer`.

- 🧠 **On-device Processing**  
  All text recognition and language detection happen on the device, ensuring fast performance and user privacy.

## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I'm currently learning how to build **intelligent iOS apps** using Apple frameworks that support computer vision and natural language processing. This project is a playground for me to explore:

- OCR and live camera integration
- Local-only NLP (Natural Language Processing)
- Voice feedback systems for accessibility
